GENERAL
    - add wall force into local minima escape routine!!!
    - for all behaviour trees we currently have a messy methodology where the robot stores internal information in both
    the blackboard and the robo_mind knowledge graph. We should change this such that all non-control information (i.e.
    not velocities, sensor rates etc), is stored in the knowledge graph only.
    - ***DONE*** - we should have the robots (or more ideally, the Hive....) clear data that is not being used or updated, i.e. all robot
    provided data where weight == 0 DONE - but be careful - need to re-ask for robot data every time we want to reiterate now, not sure if this is good...
    - we need to stop using the term 'mind'.....let's update this to 'database' so we have hive_db and robot_db
    - woulkdbe neater to refactor so there are seperate files for sim, warehouse and bt for each experiment - would be easier to navigate I think
    - repetition of exit_sim in viz_sim

bt_astr_graph
    - working with astar with the map given in the aamas_exps yaml file
    - currently only runs single A* and then always chooses that path
    - no Hive Mind

bt_astr_grid
    - grid init works but A* still needs debugging
    - stopped as possibly too complex for this application

br_no_astar
    - working by choosing a door and going waypoint to waypoint using prior information (door location)
    - also working with heading logic now based on the update that the robots continually check their door choice is a good one
